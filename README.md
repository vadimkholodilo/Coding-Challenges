# Coding-Challenges
My solutions for popular algorithmical challenges  from various websites such as https://leetcode.com/
## Intro
All solutions are written using C# programming language.
There is no a particular reason why I used that programming language instead of, let's say, Python or C++. I just like it.
I believe that during interviews or any coding contests, you should use a language which you're most comfortable with. For me, at this point, it's C#.
## Folder structure
There are 2 folders: Problems and Tests.
Problems folder has solutions (A folder per solution).
Tests folder has a set of tests for each problem.
All problems have unit tests, because that's the only way to verify that the solutions work as expected. Also, during any coding assessment, during most coding assessments, solutions are evaluated using a suite of unit tests.
